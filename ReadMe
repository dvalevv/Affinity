Change log:
- events.php : incorect syntax on echo
	     : you cannot use break in a non loop structure
	     : sizeof() cannot be used in a non countable array (line 33)
               $result is not an array, you need to fetch_assoc to get a row array.
	     : added some code to fix the sizeof ploblem

- joinevent.php : incorect syntax

-also some links to the new css and image location were not changed 

TODO list:
- when loged in, the Login/register button should have the name of the user
- make the pages resizable 
- (scroll left does not refresh the page ? )
!- login must be with email or username, the php crashes
- nothing happends when you press help button
-(why not use a for loop anyway in events.php)
- make the events not show up in a image, but in some sort of text

Notices to fix:
-() when tryed to log in, undefined index: username in (line 11 AffinityLogin)
-(fixed) have you checked your loops ? (event.php line 45, 52)

Fatal errors to fix:
-() got some 404 errors, someone check all the links and typos in them.
-() when entering nothing, an error ocures (line 28 in AffinityLogin)
-(fixed) syntax error in events.php (line 43)
-(fixed) sizeof() cannot be used in a non countable array (line 33)
-(fixed) incorect syntax (line 40 events.php)
